## 📁 Dataset Setup Instructions

This project uses the **Heart Disease dataset** stored in a file named `heart.csv`.

### Step 1: Download the dataset
- Download `heart.csv` to your local machine
- Ensure the file name remains exactly **heart.csv**

### Step 2: Upload the dataset in Google Colab
Both notebooks — `01_exploration.ipynb` and `02_modeling.ipynb` — expect the dataset to be uploaded manually when run in Google Colab.

In each notebook:
- Run the **second code cell**, which uses `files.upload()`
- When prompted, select **heart.csv** from your local machine
